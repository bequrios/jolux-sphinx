# Abstract

The **JOLux schema** is an [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/) data schema for describing **legislative texts and their relationships**.

Remarque: This repository is not the place, where JOLux is being developed but merely a place of documentation of the proven JOLux data schema.
